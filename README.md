### Show me the code!

A typical simplified command handler:

```csharp
using (var unitOfwork = unitOfWorkFactory.CreateFor<Job>())
{
    var repository = unitOfwork.GetRepository<Job>();

    var job = await repository.FindAsync(jobId);

    if (job?.Id == default)
        throw new JobNotFoundException();

    job.UpdateFrom(command.Job);

    await unitOfwork.SaveChangesAsync();
    
    await bus.RaiseEvents(job);
}
```

An integration test

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task CreateJobController_should_create_a_new_job()
{
    using (var scope = ServiceProvider.CreateScope())
    {
        // Arrange
        var bus = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IBus>();
        var logger = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<JobController>>();
        var correlationId = Guid.NewGuid();
        var controller = new JobController(bus, logger);

        var job = new JobDTO()
        {
            Title = "My job offer",
            ...
        };

        var request = new PostJobRequest(
            job,
            companyId,
            userId
            );

        // Act
        ActionResult response = await controller.CreateAsync(request, correlationId);

        // Assert
        Assert.That(response, Is.InstanceOf(typeof(OkObjectResult)));
        Assert.That...
        Assert.That...
    }
}
```

A unit test

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task SaveJobCommandHandler_should_get_a_job_entity_from_repository_given_a_valid_job_id()
{
    // Arrange
    var correlationId = Guid.NewGuid();
    var jobRepository = new Mock<IJobRepository>();
    var logger = new Mock<ILogger>();
    var job = new Mock<Job>();

    job.SetupProperty(m => m.Id, JOB_ID);
            
    var command = new SaveJobCommand(correlationId, job.Object);
    var handler = new SaveJobCommandHandler(jobRepository.Object, logger.Object);

    // Act
    await handler.Handle(command);

    // Assert
    jobRepository.Verify(r => r.FindAsync(JOB_ID), Times.Once);
}
```
